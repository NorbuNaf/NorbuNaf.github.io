    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="ifile:///Users/norbu/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Daniel%20&%20Norbu%20-%20Edit/21-IMG_7890.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">
    <p>I am Norbusamten Naftel, a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. My academic focus lies at the intersection of hardware and software, with particular emphasis on digital circuit design and implementation.</p>
    <p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have developed expertise across multiple levels of digital systems from transistor-level logic gate design to hardware description languages for circuit modeling. My coursework has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the full abstraction spectrum in computing systems. Especially when it comes to understanging the importance of using software to model hardware creating exhaustive testbenches to makesure my design works in both normal and edge cases.</p>
    <p>My technical experience includes developing various software projects using Python and Java. Notable among these is an obstacle avoidance algorithm implemented using ROS2 (Robot Operating System). This project demonstrates my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical engineering challenges.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about bridging the gap between hardware and software domains to create efficient, innovative digital solutions.</p>
