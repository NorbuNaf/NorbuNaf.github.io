            <p>I had the opportunity to work on transistor level design of the neuron that could be used in a neural network. This process taught me a ton on how to understand firstly designing logic gates using static CMOS logic but also just how iterative layout design truly is. I worked on a team of 4 students where we started by taking the problem statement and breaking up the larger neuron into smaller logic operations. We then went on to creating a truth table for each logic operation and finding optimizations in the logic gate level design from the truth table. Next we went onto creating the layout for our design. At each step of the design we made sure to thoroughly test the implementation to function exactly as the truth table calls. Once the entire neuron was created we ran quantitative analysis on the schematic to see the timing and size. We then found ways to make our design both faster AND smaller through the use of a smaller XOR gate design and tricky routing techniques on the 3 bit adders.</p>
