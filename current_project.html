            <p>I am working on a senior capstone design project to design an autonomous boat that covers around 9 square miles while emitting a low frequency magnetic wave. This is a big undertaking because of many constraints including staying within a budget of $500 and being portable. Just one of these constraints would make the project challenging but both truly test the limits of engineering. This project has taught me so much about how to actually apply all I have currently learned in education until now. Currently I am teaching myself how to use Altium to create a highly efficient buck converter to power a Raspberry Pi. We need the Raspberry Pi in the system because it is in charge of generating a low frequency AC voltage that will be boosted through an audio amp and drive a large coil that emits the low frequency magnetic wave.</p>
